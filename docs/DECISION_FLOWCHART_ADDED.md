# ✅ DECISION FLOWCHART ADDED!
## results/decision_flowchart.png Successfully Integrated

---

## 🎉 **UPDATE COMPLETE**

Good catch! I've now added the `results/decision_flowchart.png` to your paper.

---

## 📊 **NEW FIGURE ADDED**

### Figure: Algorithmic Decision Flowchart
**File:** `results/decision_flowchart.png`
**Location:** Section 3.3 (Smart Decision Logic), right after the subsection heading
**Label:** `\label{fig:decision_flowchart}`
**Reference:** Mentioned as "Figure \ref{fig:decision_flowchart}" in the text

---

## 📍 **WHERE IT WAS PLACED**

**Section 3.3: Smart Decision Logic (Algorithm)**

The flowchart is now the FIRST figure in this section, showing:

1. **Entry point:** Person detection with confidence score
2. **Confidence gate:** Decision node for $conf_{person} > 0.7$
3. **PPE detection:** YOLO scans for helmet and vest
4. **Routing decision:** High-confidence vs ambiguous cases
5. **SAM verification:** Selective semantic validation
6. **Final classification:** Compliant or violation output

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS PLACEMENT**

This flowchart serves as the **algorithmic implementation** showing:
- ✅ Complete execution flow (entry → decision nodes → processing → output)
- ✅ Diamond shapes for decision points
- ✅ Rectangular boxes for processing steps
- ✅ Green/red terminal nodes for final outputs
- ✅ Standard flowchart conventions for reproducibility

It complements the other decision figures:
- **Figure: decision_flowchart.png** → Algorithmic flowchart (technical, implementation-focused)
- **Figure: Figure_The_Smart_Decision1.png** → Conceptual routing logic (confidence branching)
- **Figure: Figure_The_Smart_Decision2.png** → Complete hierarchical tree (all 5 paths with percentages)

## 📝 **CAPTION HIGHLIGHTS**

The new caption explains:
- **Standard flowchart notation:** Diamond = decision, Rectangle = processing
- **Technical details:** Confidence thresholds ($conf_{person} > 0.7$), ROI cropping
- **Color coding:** Green terminals (compliant), Red terminals (violation), Orange paths (SAM verify)
- **Performance metrics:** 24.3 FPS throughput, 35.2% SAM activation
- **Reproducibility:** "Making the algorithm immediately reproducible by other researchers"
