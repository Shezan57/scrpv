## 📚 **OPTIONAL: Additional Citations You Could Add**

These are in `references.bib` but NOT yet in `backup.txt`. You can add them if you want to expand your Related Work section:

### 🔄 Optional Citation 1: Cascade R-CNN
**Where to add:** Section 2.3 (If you create a "Hybrid Architectures" subsection)
```latex
Cascade R-CNN \cite{cai2018cascade} demonstrated that sequential refinement with 
progressively stricter quality thresholds improves detection precision.
```

### 🔄 Optional Citation 2: MneyMneh Construction PPE
**Where to add:** Section 2 (Related Work on construction safety)
```latex
Mneymneh et al. \cite{mneymneh2019vision} developed a hardhat detection system 
achieving 94\% accuracy using traditional CNNs.
```

### 🔄 Optional Citation 3: Wu Construction Application
**Where to add:** Section 2 (Related Work on construction safety)
```latex
Wu et al. \cite{wu2019application} noted that false negatives remain the primary 
failure mode in deployed systems.
```

### 🔄 Optional Citation 4: CutMix Augmentation
**Where to add:** Section 3.1.1 (Data Augmentation)
```latex
Beyond Mosaic and MixUp, techniques like CutMix \cite{yun2019cutmix} can further 
enhance model robustness by cutting and pasting patches between images.
```

### 🔄 Optional Citation 5: Open-Vocabulary Detection
**Where to add:** Section 2.2 (Foundation Models)
```latex

## 🔧 **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO**

### Nothing! (Almost...)

The citations are already in your `backup.txt`. You just need to:

1. ✅ **Compile with BibTeX** (the `references.bib` file is ready)
   ```bash
   pdflatex backup.tex
   bibtex backup
   pdflatex backup.tex
   pdflatex backup.tex
   ```

2. ✅ **Verify in PDF** - Check that all citations appear as [1], [2], [3]...

3. ✅ **Check Bibliography** - Confirm all 24 references appear at the end

## 📋 **COPY-PASTE READY BibTeX File**

The complete `references.bib` is already in your project folder:
```
d:\SHEZAN\AI\scrpv\references.bib
```

It contains 30+ references, with 24 already cited in your paper.
